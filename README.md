- 👋 Hi, I’m @frabjous.
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Educational Resources, LaTeX, neovim, and everything Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GitHub and try not to be bothered by its ownership by Microsoft.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the same stuff as the stuff I'm interested in of course.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email <klement@umass.edu> Web: <http://people.umass.edu/klement>
